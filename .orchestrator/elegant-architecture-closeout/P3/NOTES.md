# P3 orchestrator notes — sweep/self-check SLO baseline

**Phase:** P3 (`proj/elegant-architecture-closeout/phase-3-slo-baseline`)
**Task:** TASK-498 (`dsp_mrw48lgrlubyiy`)
**Checkout stamp:** `MC-Checkout: dsp_mrw4askd1tb0lz`

## What shipped

- Measurement-only artifact bundle under `artifacts/platform/2026-07-22-sweep-self-check-slo/`.
- Sequential helper (`measure.mjs`) with concurrency 1 and hard stop on first non-2xx.
- Production samples for `GET /api/cron/sweep` (12 × 5 min) and `GET /api/cursor/self-check` (30 evenly spaced across the same ≥55 min window).
- Deterministic nearest-rank p50/p95 in `summary.json`, recomputed by `_verify.mjs`.
- No changes to `src/**`, runtime, cadence, dependencies, or tracked secrets.

## Auth hydration (session-only)

- `MC_MCP_API_KEY` / `MC_OPERATOR_EMAIL` from `.secrets-env.staging.ps1`.
- `CRON_SECRET` from Vercel production env (API decrypt) or local runtime env file — never written to tracked files.

## Limitations

- Single workstation egress path; no multi-region sampling.
- Manual sweep triggers add load beyond native five-minute cron; baseline reflects operator-initiated sequential probes, not passive cron-only observation.
- Self-check includes DB/Graph probe work; sweep includes full delta pass — thresholds are latency envelopes, not functional SLOs.

## Parent integration

- Do **not** mark TASK-498 complete here; parent merges via `/apply-worktree` after integration review.

## Parent acceptance corrections

- Removed Markdown trailing whitespace reported by `git diff --check`.
- Removed the Vercel `--token` CLI argument; the child process inherits the required `VERCEL_TOKEN` environment variable.
- Added `_verify.mjs` enforcement against reintroducing a quoted `--token` argument in `measure.mjs`.
- Bounded the reported 401 explanation to observed evidence; root cause remains unestablished.
