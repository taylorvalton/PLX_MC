# Compliance gate drift-check (EN-007). plx-mc-compliance.yml in this repo is a
# generated copy of the PLX MC compliance gate. The single source is
# scripts/generate-compliance-gate.py in the PUBLIC taylorvalton/PLX_MC repo,
# pinned to a commit SHA. This job fetches that generator, emits the downstream
# variant, and diffs it against the committed gate — failing on drift.
